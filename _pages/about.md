Welcome to my homepage!

I’m Paul, an AI Scientist from Halat, Lebanon. My research interest lies in AI, optimization and controls. I graduated from Northeastern Unviersity with a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I conducted research on various topics including imitation learning, learning on latent spaces, online learning, second order newton optimization and multi-agent control. Applications of my research included Robotics, Biological systems and audio time series. I have published more than a dozen papers at top-tier AI and controls conferences such as AAAI, Neurips, TAC, IROS, ACC and CDC. 

The best way to reach me for career-related stuff is by shooting me an email at ghanem.p@northeastern.edu. I am genuinely interested in forming meaningful connections with fellow AI scientists, engineers, students, etc, so feel free to reach out even if we never met in person.

Aside from AI, I love playing soccer, skiing, and weight lifting!

Research Statement
======
My research lies at the intersection of imitation learning (IL), online learning, and latent variable modeling, with the goal of building intelligent systems that learn from demonstrations and adapt in real time to uncertain, dynamic environments. I develop algorithms that move beyond behavior cloning to infer the latent structure, goals, and dynamics underlying expert behavior — enabling robust generalization under partial observability and distribution shift.

In parallel, I develop methods for learning compact and expressive latent representations from high-dimensional, noisy, and partially observed time series, where the true system state is not directly measurable. These latent variables act as internal models of the hidden dynamics, enabling structured planning, long-horizon prediction, and feedback control in environments with incomplete or indirect observations.

To support this, I integrate tools from control theory and Bayesian state estimation with modern machine learning, incorporating concepts such as recursive filtering, dynamical systems modeling, and optimal control. These frameworks introduce structure, inductive bias, and principled uncertainty quantification — improving both data efficiency and decision-making in complex, time-evolving systems.

Ultimately, my goal is to build adaptive, interpretable, and scalable learning systems that operate under uncertainty, learn from limited supervision, and align with human intent — with applications in robotics, behavioral modeling, and intelligent assistive technologies.


Trajectory
======

From 2020-2025 I was a PhD student at Northeastern University in the Machine Learning Group with Prof. Deniz Erdogmus and in the robotics group, headed by Prof. Alireza Ramezani.
At the same time, I had the pleasure of working as a machine learning research intern at Bose Corporation.

From 2019-2020 I was a Controls Software Engineer at Airgilty

From 2017-2019 I was a Masters student at University of Maryland  in the Collective Dynamics and Controls Lab with Prof. Derek Paley.

From 2016-2017 I was a Lab Instructor and researcher Assistant in Controls and Robotics at the Lebanese American University  advised (then and now) by Prof. Samer Saab.
